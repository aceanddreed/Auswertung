TODO: explain p-value? describe our p-value results -> reasons for inaccurate results.
.) 30 not a lot for quantitative study
.) misunderstandings raise the variance
.) variance generally very high, because some people might not answer that precisely, but the margin we are looking for is very small -> hence we would need a lot of people for the variance to even out
.) study system has to be supervised. to enable a study with many people -> make it understandable and robust enough to not be supervised
.) study length. short study = less results, longer study = tedious, worse results because people loose focus; list pros and cons of study length
